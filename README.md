# YoutubeTranslator
The YouTube Video Translator Tool is a Flask-based web application that allows users to translate YouTube videos into different languages. The tool downloads a YouTube video, extracts audio, transcribes it, translates the text, converts it into speech, and merges it back into a video with the translated audio.
